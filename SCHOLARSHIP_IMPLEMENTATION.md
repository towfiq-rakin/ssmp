- **Replaced "Departments"** with **"Scholarships"** in the admin navigation menu
- Added link to `/admin/scholarships` route for admin users

### 3. Backend Routes (`routes/main.py`)
Added the following routes:

- Displays eligible students for scholarships
- **Eligibility Criteria**:

  - GPA >= 3.8 → BUP Scholarship (৳9,000)
- Shows:

#### d. `/admin/scholarship/approve-all` (POST)

### 4. Frontend Templates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend JavaScript Functions:
- `approveScholarship(studentId, amount)`: Approves individual scholarship via AJAX
- `rejectScholarship(studentId, amount)`: Removes student from list locally
- `updateTotals(amount, newBudget)`: Updates displayed totals
- `approveAll()`: Bulk approves all eligible scholarships

### Database Operations:
- JOIN query between `students` and `academic_records` tables
- Budget deduction on scholarship approval
- Atomic transactions for data consistency
- Timestamp tracking for scholarship awards

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with different GPA values**:
   - GPA >= 3.9 (Chancellor Scholarship)
   - GPA >= 3.8 (BUP Scholarship)
   - GPA < 3.8 (Not eligible)

2. **Test budget constraints**:
   - Approve scholarships until budget is exhausted
   - Verify error handling for insufficient budget

3. **Test duplicate prevention**:
   - Attempt to approve same student twice
   - Verify semester-based duplicate checking

4. **Test UI interactions**:
   - Individual approve/reject buttons
   - "Approve All" functionality
   - Real-time total updates

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
